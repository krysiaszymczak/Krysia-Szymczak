                    <p>In June of 2024, rapper, singer, and songwriter, Don Toliver, released his 4th studio album, Hardstone Psycho. This album was highly anticipated because of the two singles, “Deep In The Water” and “Attitude”, he dropped before the release. This album is a showcase of the evolution of his work as an artist and it shows through the lyrics and the production of each song. The album takes us through a rollercoaster of emotions as it starts off with the electric guitar riffs of “Kryptonite” and ends with a sentimental sound of longing through “Hardstone National Anthem”. That isn't the only reason this album stands out however. Toliver collabed with prominent artists such as Travis Scott, Future, Metro Boomin’, Charlie Wilson, and Teezo Touchdown. Each artist brings a different and unique sound to the song they are featured on.

                    <p>Now that we have an overview of the album, let's get to reviewing some of my favorite tracks. I listened to the album all the way through, from track 1 to track 16 so that is the order I will be going in for right now. First stand-out track was actually not a song I went back to for a while but once I did, game over. “Ice Age” sounds a little similar to Travis Scott’s “RIP Screw” off his Astroworld album, which makes sense because Travis is the one we hear first on the track. But besides that, I think Don’s verse is what makes the song a hit. Second stand-out track was “Purple Rain” featuring Future. This track takes you on a rollercoaster ride as it starts out slow and mellow and just blows you away when the beat drops and it is an uphill ride from there. Personally, I don’t think Future has a bad feature so him being on this song just fits and makes sense. “Inside” featuring Travis Scott was not only one of my favorite tracks, but the world seemed to praise it as well. When these two artists collaborate, they are unstoppable. The sound of the song has been described as psychedelic, which I agree with. And lastly, my number one favorite song on the album, that quite literally brought tears to my eyes, is “Hardstone National Anthem”. This song is a prime example of Toliver’s versatility and vocal range. The lyrics reflect themes of luxury, romance, and self-assuredness. I do have some honorable mentions that I want to point out such as “Last Laugh”, “Glock”, “New Drop”, and “5 to 10”. </p>
                    <p>This was Toliver’s last album signed to Cactus Jack Records. Since then, he has started his own record label called “Hardstone Records”. In an interview, Don Toliver discussed his vision for Hardstone Records, emphasizing collaboration with upcoming artists. While specific artists signed to the label haven't been publicly announced, the label's establishment reflects Toliver's commitment to fostering new talent and expanding his influence in the music industry. I am excited to see where this new chapter takes him and I am excited to hear the evolution of his music. </p>
